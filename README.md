# One NF Analysis a Week
###Or something like that.

A place to try out one new approach, dataset, hypothesis, etc each week(ish - it's an aspirational repo name), with a focus on neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis. 

Ideally, these should be relatively quick and dirty analyses that don't require an incredible amount of time. If the analysis start to become substantial enough or interesting enough to merit more than a few days worth of work, congratulations! It's time to graduate that to its own repo and project.
