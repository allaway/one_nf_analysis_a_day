# One NF Analysis a Week

(Or close to it, at least.)

A place to try out one new approach, dataset, hypothesis, etc each week(ish - it's aspirational), with a focus on neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis.

These should be relatively quick and dirty analyses that don't require an incredible amount of time. If the analysis start to become substantial enough or interesting enough to merit more than a few days worth of work, congratulations! It's time to graduate that to its own repo and project.

The goal of this effort is to poke at the public NF data that exists while sharing the results immediately (i.e. - no private folders here!). Please be sure that ALL data used for your analysis is *publicly available* on Synapse or via credential-free https download.
